Hi! I am Akshat, an 18 year old self-taught AI engineer, entrepreneur and developer. I'm currently diving into the fields of AI/ML and maths. I'm also passionate about robotics, blockchain, and contributing to open-source projects, primarily in AI.

Beyond tech, I have a deep love for reading books. My favorite genres include science, sci-fi, philosophy, psychology, history, and biographies. You can explore my bookshelf on [Goodreads](#).

I'm also the founder of [Noises Labs](#), an open-source AI research lab dedicated to enhancing the training, fine-tuning, and inference capabilities of pre-trained large language models.

Currently I'm working on:

- [Deven](#): An open-source AI code agent alternative to Devin.
- [OpenDeepLearning](https://www.opendeeplearning.xyz/): A nonprofit AI community enhancing open AI education.
