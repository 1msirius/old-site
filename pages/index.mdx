## Hi! this is Sirius.

I usually go by the Sirius on the Internet, though my real name is Akshat.
I'm an 18 year old AI researcher, entrepreneur, and developer deeply passionate about generative AI.

My interests also include blockchain, robotics, hardware and contributing to open-source projects, primarily in AI.

I'm the founder of [Narsil AI](http://narsilai.com/), where I focus on enhancing the training, fine-tuning, and inference capabilities of pre-trained large language models and releasing open datasets. You can find my contributions on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Sirius27).

Beyond tech, I'm an avid reader with a diverse taste in books. My preferred genres include science, sci-fi, philosophy, psychology, history, classics and biography. You can explore my bookshelf on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/akshattalapa).

If you're interested in collaborating on LLMs, AI agents, or other, just DM me on Twitter at [@Sirius_AI_](https://x.com/Sirius_AI_).  I'm always open to new ideas and projects!
