## Hello, I'm Sirius!

I usually go by the Sirius on the Internet, though my real name is Akshat.
I'm an 18 year old self-taught AI engineer, entrepreneur, and developer. 

I'm currently diving deep into the realms of AI/ML and mathematics. My interests extend to robotics, blockchain, and contributing to open-source projects, primarily in AI.

Beyond tech, I'm an avid reader with a diverse taste in books. My preferred genres include science, sci-fi, philosophy, psychology, history, classics and biography. You can explore my bookshelf on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/akshattalapa).

I'm actively involved in AI research and the founder of [Erevna Labs](http://erevnalabs.com/). My primary focus is enhancing the training, fine-tuning, and inference capabilities of pre-trained large language models, while also releasing open datasets. You can find my contributions on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Sirius27).

For more information about my professional journey and interests, feel free to explore my [written works](/posts) and [projects](/projects).
