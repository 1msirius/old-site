## Hi, I'm Sirius!

I usually go by the Sirius on the Internet, though my real name is Akshat.
I'm an 18-year-old AI scientist, entrepreneur, and developer with a passion for AI and LLMs.

My interests also include blockchain, robotics, hardware and contributing to open-source projects, primarily in AI.

I'm actively involved in AI research and the founder of [Erevna Labs](http://erevnalabs.com/). My primary focus is enhancing the training, fine-tuning, and inference capabilities of pre-trained large language models, while also releasing open datasets. You can find my contributions on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Sirius27).

Beyond tech, I'm an avid reader with a diverse taste in books. My preferred genres include science, sci-fi, philosophy, psychology, history, classics and biography. You can explore my bookshelf on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/akshattalapa).

If you're interested in collaborating on LLMs, AI agents, or other, just DM me on Twitter at @sirius80.  I'm always open to new ideas and projects!
