## Hi! This is Sirius.

I usually go by Sirius on the Internet, though my real name is Akshat. I'm an 18-year-old AI researcher, entrepreneur, and developer deeply passionate about generative AI.

My interests also include robotics, hardware, blockchain, and contributing to open-source projects, primarily in AI.

I'm the founder and CEO of [Narsil AI](http://narsilai.com/), where I focus on enhancing the training, fine-tuning, and inference capabilities of pre-trained large language models and releasing open datasets. You can find my contributions on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Sirius27).

I'm also the creator of [OpenDeepLearning](https://www.opendeeplearning.xyz/), an open-source AI community dedicated to advancing AI education, where I teach machine learning and mathematics.

Beyond tech, I'm an avid reader with a diverse taste in books. My preferred genres include science, sci-fi, philosophy, psychology, history, classics, and biography. You can explore my bookshelf on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/akshattalapa).

If you're interested in collaborating on generative AI or any other projects, just DM me on Twitter at [@1msirius\_](https://x.com/1msirius_). I'm always open to new ideas and projects!
